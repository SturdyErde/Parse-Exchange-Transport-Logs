# Parse-Exchange-Transport-Logs
Parse your Exchange transport logs to find out which devices are sending messages to your Exchange Server's receive connector.

## To Do
* Wrap reused blocks in functions (eg: getting the message subject)
* Add a function to pull the logs? I'm currently copying them manually whenever I want to analyze them.
* Have fun learning.
